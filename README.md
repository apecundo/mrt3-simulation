# mrt3-simulation
Project simulating MRT-3 queue time subject to various conditions via Discrete-Event Simulation. Objective of the exercise was to measure the queueing time of passengers  during the rush hour operations of the train station and the effect of certain interventions on the queueing time.

4 possible conditions were considered in the exercise to measure the impact of action points on improvement of queueing time of passengers:

Condition 1: Baseline Condition (Train Operating Based on Current Condition)
Condition 2: Increased Number of Trains Operating only
Condition 3: Increased Train Speed only
Condition 4: Train Skipping At Certain Stations During Full Capacity only
